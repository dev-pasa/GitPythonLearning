# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way
This is my attempt to learn Python! on my own using "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code", 
Book by Zed Shaw.

Not all the assignment are complete. 

#IDE
I did not use any IDE for this book. The scripts were run in the commandline. I used Notepad++ to make edits to the scripts.
